    "## Methods to to solve for Klinkenberg Permeability from Permeability to air:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, while exploring PermInc.com, I stumbled upon an intriguing approach utilizing the Newton-Raphson method to convert permeability to air measurements into Klinkenberg permeability. While the website provided an outline, understanding and implementing the concept required translating it into Python code. Additionally, delving deeper, I reviewed API Recommended Practices RP-40.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RP-40's appendix, Jones introduced a correlation for helium's b (Klinkenberg gas slippage factor) using an equation (A-7):\n",
    "\n",
    "    b_Helium = 16.4 * Kl^(-0.382)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 'b' represents the Klinkenberg gas slippage factor in psi and 'Kl' denotes the Klinkenberg Permeability in mD. The document suggests calculating 'b_air' by substituting 16.4 with 5.71:\n",
    "\n",
    "    b_air = 5.71 * Kl^(-0.382)\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying equation 21 of RP-40, which relates to air:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Kair = Kl * (1 + b_air / p_mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "For air, this equation simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Kair = Kl + 5.71 * Kl^(1 - 0.382) / p_mean\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can be reformulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.71 * Kl^0.618 + Kl * p_mean - Kair * p_mean = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method necessitates the derivative of the function concerning the variable being solved for (in this instance, Kl) to iteratively converge towards the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of the function f(Kl) = 5.71 * Kl^0.618 + Kl * p_mean - Kair * p_mean with respect to Kl is derived as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f'(Kl) = df(Kl)/dKl = 5.71 * 0.618 * Kl^(-0.382) + p_mean\n",
    "\n",
    "This derivative, f'(Kl), is crucial in updating the guessed value for Kl iteratively. It assists in determining how to update the guess to converge towards the root (or solution) of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python code for the Newton-Raphson, SciPy Optimization  and excel spreadsheet can be found on this GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "All 3 coded examples provide the same estimated for Klinkenberg permeability based on the given data from RP-40 utilized in equation 31, resulting in an estimated Kl of 10.61, where in RP-40 the Klinkenberg Permeability is 10.62, indicating a close approximation.\n",

    "The choice of optimization method depends on various factors such as the properties of the function, availability of derivatives, computational resources, convergence behavior, and the specific problem at hand. Each optimization method has its strengths and limitations. Here's a summary of considerations for the methods discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Newton-Raphson Method:**\n",
    "   - Requires both the function and its derivative.\n",
    "   - Converges rapidly for well-behaved functions when a good initial guess is provided.\n",
    "   - May not converge or converge to a local minimum/maximum for poorly behaved functions.\n",
    "   - Efficient if derivatives can be computed accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`scipy.optimize.root_scalar`:**\n",
    "   - Specifically designed for root-finding.\n",
    "   - Utilizes different algorithms including Newton-Raphson, secant, Brent's method, etc.\n",
    "   - Requires fewer function evaluations than `scipy.optimize.minimize`.\n",
    "   - May be more straightforward to use for root-finding problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`scipy.optimize.minimize`:**\n",
    "   - General-purpose optimization tool that can solve root-finding problems by minimizing a function (like least squares minimization).\n",
    "   - Doesn't require derivatives in some methods (e.g., Nelder-Mead) but can benefit from derivatives for faster convergence in others.\n",
    "   - Suitable for more general optimization problems beyond root-finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your specific problem of finding the root of the equation \\(f(x) = 0\\) for the Klinkenberg permeability, if you have access to derivatives and are mainly focused on root-finding, using `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` with the Newton-Raphson method could be a good choice. This method tends to converge quickly if a good initial guess is provided and if the function behaves well around the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a more general optimization problem or when derivatives are not easily computable, using `scipy.optimize.minimize` with appropriate methods, such as Nelder-Mead, can be versatile and may not require derivative information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice should be based on the specific characteristics of your function, computational requirements, availability of derivative information, and the level of confidence you seek in the convergence behavior of the optimization method. It might be beneficial to experiment with different methods and compare their performance for your particular problem to determine the most suitable one."
